# open-jam
An app made to help with ear training and instrument/vocal practice. 

# Primary Focus
I care more about the backend right now than any UI stuff  
If you don't wanna look at a command line interface feel free to fork and do 
whatever you want to make it pretty

# High level features
1. Metronome
    - Input patterns where it cuts out
2. Tuner
    - Later this will be used for long tone things
3. Tone analyzer
4. Volume checker
5. Call and repeat generator
6. Sight reading generator (probably needs AI...)



This is a prototype
- Do not expect cross platform compatibility
- Do expect bugs
- Do not expect stuff to be optimized
- Do expect things to go horribly wrong
- Do not expect me to fix every problem you find
- Do expect bugs to persist through the entire prototype (they'll be fixed in a full release)
- Do not expect me to list anything else...
