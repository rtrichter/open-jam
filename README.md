# open-jam
An app made to help with ear training and instrument/vocal practice. 

This is a prototype
- Do not expect cross platform compatibility
- Do expect bugs
- Do not expect stuff to be optimized
- Do expect things to go horribly wrong
- Do not expect me to fix every problem you find
- Do expect bugs to persist through the entire prototype (they'll be fixed in a full release)
- Do not expect me to list anything else...
